Install MySQLdb module version 2.0.x
For installing MySQLdb, you need to have MySQL installed: How to install MySQL 8.0 in Ubuntu 20.04

$ sudo apt-get install python3-dev
$ sudo apt-get install libmysqlclient-dev
$ sudo apt-get install zlib1g-dev
$ sudo pip3 install mysqlclient
...
$ python3
>>> import MySQLdb
>>> MySQLdb.version_info 
(2, 0, 3, 'final', 0)
Install SQLAlchemy module version 1.4.x

Write a script that lists all states from the database hbtn_0e_0_usa:

Your script should take 3 arguments: mysql username, mysql password and database name (no argument validation needed)
You must use the module MySQLdb (import MySQLdb)
Your script should connect to a MySQL server running on localhost at port 3306
Results must be sorted in ascending order by states.id
Results must be displayed as they are in the example below
Your code should not be executed when imported


Write a script that lists all states with a name starting with N (upper N) from the database hbtn_0e_0_usa:

Your script should take 3 arguments: mysql username, mysql password and database name (no argument validation needed)
You must use the module MySQLdb (import MySQLdb)
Your script should connect to a MySQL server running on localhost at port 3306
Results must be sorted in ascending order by states.id
Results must be displayed as they are in the example below
Your code should not be executed when imported


Write a script that takes in an argument and displays all values in the states table of hbtn_0e_0_usa where name matches the argument.

Your script should take 4 arguments: mysql username, mysql password, database name and state name searched (no argument validation needed)
You must use the module MySQLdb (import MySQLdb)
Your script should connect to a MySQL server running on localhost at port 3306
You must use format to create the SQL query with the user input
Results must be sorted in ascending order by states.id
Results must be displayed as they are in the example below
Your code should not be executed when imported


Wait, do you remember the previous task? Did you test "Arizona'; TRUNCATE TABLE states ; SELECT * FROM states WHERE name = '" as an input?

guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x0F$ ./2-my_filter_states.py root root hbtn_0e_0_usa "Arizona'; TRUNCATE TABLE states ; SELECT * FROM states WHERE name = '"
(2, 'Arizona')
guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x0F$ ./0-select_states.py root root hbtn_0e_0_usa
guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x0F$ 
What? Empty?

Yes, it’s an SQL injection to delete all records of a table…

Once again, write a script that takes in arguments and displays all values in the states table of hbtn_0e_0_usa where name matches the argument. But this time, write one that is safe from MySQL injections!
